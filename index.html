                        Wellington Fountain.The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the

                        inspired by elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument by

                        India.The construction of the fort provided the impetus for further settlements and trading
                        activity, in what was originally an uninhabited land.Thus, it is a feasible contention to
                        say that the city (formerly named Madras) evolved around the fortress.The fort currently
                        houses the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly and other official buildings.</p>

                        'City of Palaces', and there are seven palaces including this one. However, the Mysore Palace
                        refers specifically to the one within the new fort.</p>

                        capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad
                        Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal
                        architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian
