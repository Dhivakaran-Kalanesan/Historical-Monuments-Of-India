                        existence of a mosque on its top floor for more than 425 years. While both historically and
                        religiously significant, it is also known for its popular and busy local markets surrounding the
                        structure, and has become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad. Charminar

                        the city of Mumbai (Bombay), India. It was erected to commemorate the landing of King-Emperor
                        George V, the first British monarch to visit India, in December 1911 at Strand Road near
                        Wellington Fountain.The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the
                        Indo-Islamic style,
                        inspired by elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument by
                        architect George Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The
                        structure is a memorial arch made of basalt, which is 26 metres (85 feet) high, with an
                        architectural resemblance to a triumphial arch as well as Gujarati architecture of the time.</p>

                        city of Chennai, India. Founded in 1639, it was the first English (later British) fortress in
                        India.The construction of the fort provided the impetus for further settlements and trading
                        activity, in what was originally an uninhabited land.Thus, it is a feasible contention to
                        say that the city (formerly named Madras) evolved around the fortress.The fort currently
                        houses the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly and other official buildings.</p>

                        between the Indian government and a movement led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.[13] In 1984,
                        Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent in the Indian Army as part of Operation Blue Star, leading to
                        deaths of over 1,000 soldiers and civilians, as well as causing much damage to the Gurdwara and
                        the destruction of Akal Takht. The Gurdwara complex was rebuilt again after the 1984 damage.</p>
